#[1] Number of Longitude Points (will be spread evenly around 360deg)
128
#[3] Inner Radius (divided by rS, ie. a value of 30 yields an inner radius of 30rS)
21.5
#[5] Outer Radius (divided by rS, as above, 215 rS is Earth Radius)
240
#[7] Radial gridspace (deltaR, divided by rS as above)
1
#[9] Alpha (for use in solar wind propagation model, default=0.15)
0.15
#[11] r_H (for use in solar wind propagation model, default=50, value divided by rS as above)
