1
#[7] Number of Longitude Points (will be spread evenly around 360deg)
128
#[9] Inner Radius (divided by rS, ie. a value of 30 yields an inner radius of 30rS)
30
#[11] Outer Radius (divided by rS, as above, 215 rS is Earth Radius)

#[31] Which observations are to be assimilated (write a string of the letters A,B and/or C: A=STERA, B=STERB, C=ACE) eg. ABC means assimilated all obs. streams, AC means assimilated STER A and ACE only
C
#[33] Should R be generated as a percentage of the solar wind or as a constant supplied by the user (Write B for background solar wind or C for constant standard deviation, then provide 3 constants seperated by a space indicating the percentage of background (0,1] or constant>0 for STERA, STERB and ACE [even if not assim.])
